# BaseSolveTask

This script takes a multi-FASTA file of DNA sequences, randomly selects 10 sequences, and introduces mutations in a randomly selected subsequence. The modified sequences are then saved to a new multi-FASTA file.
## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Biopython installed. If not, you can install it using:
       ```bash
         pip install biopython
   
2.  Run the Script:
                     basesolvetask.ipynb
    
4. Use the given file as input Multifasta file
                                               my_primary.fasta
   
6. Here i have selected 10  random sequences but you can select no of sequences of your intrest
